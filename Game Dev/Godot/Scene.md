A game made in Godot is a tree of Scenes. Scenes can really be anything: a character, a weapon, a menu, etc. Scenes can be nested under scenes, such as a player in a level.

Scenes are made up of individual [[Node|nodes]] which describe the behavior of a scene. A tree of scenes is also a tree of nodes.
