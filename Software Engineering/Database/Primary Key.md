A primary key is a column that contains only distinct values within a table. A user id is an example of a single value primary key. Primary keys can also be defined with multiple columns as long as the combined value is unique for the table. It is generally better to have a single column unique value for the primary key as that allows other tables to reference it as a [[Foreign Key|foreign key]].
