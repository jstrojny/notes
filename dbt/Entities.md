In dbt's [[Semantic Models|semantic modeling]] system entities represent the what of the model. Entities should be thought of as nouns to which some action has happened that we want to quantify. Entities have three pieces: a name, a type, and an expression (expr).

An entity's name is either the column name of the underlying table or it can be an alias with the expr value specifying the column.

The type can be one of four values: primary, unique, foreign, or natural. A primary entity only has one record per row in the underlying table but every row in the data platform. A unique entity has only record per row in the table. It may also have multiple rows in the data warehouse and can be null. A foreign entity can have zero to many records including null values for the same record. A natural entity is a column or combination of columns that can identify unique records. This is similar to a [[Surrogate Key|surrogate key]].
