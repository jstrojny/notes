The end goal, a unified view of the organization's data that is to be exposed to end users. Marts are built around a single concept or entity, such as products or clicks. Each row is an instance of that entity. Marts are generally [[Normalization|denormalized]] because storage is cheap while compute is not. While this duplicates data it saves on performing multiple joins in the mart itself. This has a side benefit of simplifying the logic of the marts.

This is the layer where we begin separating data into business concepts, potentially naming folders by what business unit will consume them. Files themselves should be named after the entity they represent. If business units would consume this data in different ways or need additional context added to them the marts should not be named by department but by the specific need.

At this layer we should begin considering materializing as tables instead of views, however, if the views are still fast to query it may still be worth the storage to not be a table. Care should be given to update the materialization as necessary views to tables, tables to incremental tables. As each step up adds complexity to the modeling itself.
