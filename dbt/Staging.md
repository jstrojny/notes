This is where source-conformed data lands and is initially ingested. Subdirectories should represent where the data is coming from *not* what business unit it belongs to or what tool is loading it. The files within these subdirectories should follow the naming format `stg_[source]__[entity]s.sql`. This shows what layer the file exists in, what the actual source is, and the entities, plural because tables rarely only have one thing in them, in a clear way with the extra underscore keeping entity and source unambiguous.

Staging is intended for modeling the base data and as such operations such as grouping or joining should generally be avoided. Keeping the widest base of available data, in a cleaned state, means we can have flexibility later when applying those operations.

For a similar reason staging level models are almost always views, storing them as a table doesn't make sense as they're not intended for the mart consumer. A view also provides always up to date information as downstream models will re-run the query.
